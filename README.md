# Axivity AX3 Case

## About This Project
The Axivity AX3 is a 3-axis data logging accelerometer in the form factor of a puck. This project seeks to design a universal method to attach AX3 onto a wide variety of body parts, including but not limited to wrists, thighs, chests, of people and animals.

## The Repository
### Major Versions
Relevant files for each major version of the design is placed in its own folder. These files can include the 3D model itself (.stl), Gcode for select FDM printers and renders taken in CAD.

### FDM Gcode
Testing prototypes are manufactured with fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printers. The available Gcodes are directly plug and play with stock counterparts of their printers. The table below lists the prefix in the filename of the Gcode to its corresponding printer. If your printer is not part of the list, you may have to slice the 3D model in a slicer (such as [UltiMaker's Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)) before it can be printed.

| Manufacturer   | Model       | Nozzle Size | Prefix  |
